Calling a function :
   Func<<< Dg, Db, Ns >>>(parameter)
	Where Dg, Db, Ns are :

	Dg is of type dim3, dimension and size of the grid

	Dg.x * Dg.y = number of blocks being launched;

	Db is of type dim3, dimension and size of each block

	Db.x * Db.y * Db.z = number of threads per block;

	Ns is of type size_t, number of bytes in shared memory that is dynamically allocated in addition to the statically allocated memory

	Ns is an optional argument which defaults to 0.

	Built-in Variables

	gridDim is of type dim3, dimensions of the grid.

	blockIdx is of type uint3, block index within the grid.

	blockDim is of type dim3, dimensions of the block.

	threadIdx is of type uint3, thread index within the block.
